# ABSTRACT
An endoscopy is a procedure in which a doctor uses specializedinstruments to view and operate on the internal organs and vesselsof the body. This paper aims to detect the diseases and abnormalitiesin the Gastro-Intestinal Tract using multimedia data. It differs fromother projects in the medical domain because it does not use medicalimaging like X-rays, CT scan etc. The dataset, which comprises of 5293 images, is provided by MediaEval Benchmarking Initiativefor Multimedia Evaluation. The data is collected during traditionalcolonoscopy procedures. Techniques from the fields of multimediacontent analysis (to extract information from the visual data) andmachine learning (for classification) have been used. On testingdata, 98% accuracy, 0.76 F1and an MCC of 0.75 is achieved usingmajority voting of logistic regression, random forest, and extratrees classifiers.
